              Getting back to our Roots
            </h2><img class="imgright" src="img/seetha.png" />
            <p>
              The Ramapuram Family traces its origins to a small
              town called Palai situated on the banks of the
              Meenachil River. Palai is situated in District of
              Kottaym towards the south of Kerala (also known as
              "Gods Own Country").
            </p>
            <p>
              The members of the Ramapuram Family are the
              descendants of Varkey Ramapuram. Varkey Ramapuram was
              the son of Thommen Vellilapilly Kizhakedath of the
              Cholapilly family of Ramapuram town.
            </p>
            <p>
              Around 1700 AD when Thommen Vellilapilly Kizhakedath
              passed away at a young age, his pregnant wife with
              his son came back to Palai from Ramapuram to live
              with her family. Since they came from the place
              called Ramapuram they were called Ramapurathe (from
              Ramapuram) hence the name stuck and now the
              descendants of Varkey are known as the Ramapuram
              Family.
            </p>
            <h2>
              Where we are from
            </h2>
            <p>
              The members of the Ramapuram Family are basically
              from a town called Palai in Meenachil Taluk, Kottayam
              District, Kerala, India. Palai is set on the banks of
              the Meenachil River and is known for its literature
              and Production of Rubber.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can read more about palai at the <a href=
              "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palai">Palai Page on

              What's in here
            </h2>
            <p>
              For the members of the Ramapuram family and others
              who are connected to the Ramapuram Family I have put
              together the following:

            <p>
              The highlight of the site is the family tree.
              Basically it is a program that stores all the
              information of the family members and links them with
              each other. It has links to media items and an option
              to upload media onto the site. Since the family is
              rather large and information changes regularly. The
              program facilitates many people to maintain the
              family tree. Details such as additions to the family,
              death, marriages can be edited with anyone who has
              the right to do so.
            </p>
            <p>
              Help is more than welcome. I would like the active
              participation of all the family members in updating
              the tree. Currently there are around 1400 members in
              the family tree. I would like to see that number
              increase at least 20 times by the end of the year.
              Another point to note is that it is not enough to
              enter the details of a person on the family tree. We
              also have to collect some kind of record for the
              details of the person. We have a module called
              research assistant for that in the program.
            </p>
            <p>
              A couple of years back I had been to the Cholapally
              family meeting and they wanted to reprint the book.
              With this program the information is always updated
              and there is no need for a book as all the
              information is available to anybody who has access to
              a computer.

              I was able to translate our family history from the
              Cholapilly Family History Book. The translated
              version is available <a href="history.html">here</a>.
              The page details our family history very generally
              from the time of the Aryans migrated to India to the
              time Marthanda Varma attacked and annexed
              Vadakunkoor(AD 1751). It is only from then that we
              have a detailed account of our Geneology.
