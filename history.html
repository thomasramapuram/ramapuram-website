              History of the Ramapuram Family
            </h1>
            <h2>
              Introduction:
            </h2>
            <p>
              The members of the Ramapuram Family are the
              Descendants of Thommen Vellilapilly Kezekedethu.
              Thommen was a member of the Cholapilly family and
              died in his youth. His wife who was from Palai and
              pregnant with the second child returned to Palai to
              live with her family. Thommen had 2 Children, Varkey
              and Fr. Joseph. Since this family had come from
              Ramapuram. They came to be known as the Ramapuram
              Family.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before going into the details of the family history
              as such I will give a background about the place this
              happened around the time it happened. As all of you
              know that the Conversion of Brahmins is central to
              any Syrian Christian family history and our family is
              no exception. I have started with the migration of
              the Dravidians from North India to South India and
              then went on to explain how trade existed with the
              middle east which led St Thomas to come to Kerala so
              on and so forth.
            </p><!--break-->
            <h2>
              Aryans and the Dravidians:
            </h2>
            <p>
              Around 4000 BC the Dravidians who had settled in
              North India where driven South by the Central Asian
              Aryans who came south crossing the Vindya Mountains.
              The Dravidian who came south started Agriculture. By
              1000 BC a lot of Brahmin families from the North came
              south and settled down. The Chera Dynasty came to
              Kodungaloor and made Thiruvanjikulam their capital
              and ruled the Dravidians.
            </p>
            <h2>
              Trade with the Middle East:
            </h2>
            <p>
              Even before 1000 BC there were a lot of Jews in the
              Region now called Kerala who used to trade with
              Syria, Palestine and other Middle Eastern Countries
              in commodities like Pepper, Ginger, Cinnamon,
              Cardamom and Sandal Wood in return for Gold, Silver,
              Copper, Bronze and Perfumes. When the Roman Empire
              came to power they found Sea Routes to India from
              Syria, Palestine etc.
            </p>
            <h2>
              The Malayalam Language:
            </h2>
            <p>
              The language of the Dravidians was Tamil. Although
              Aryan's who spoke Sanskrit migrated south their
              language was limited to religious functions and
              ceremonies. After some time a new language came into
              being which was a mixture of Tamil and Sanskrit. By
              AD 1300 this language Malayalam became an independent
              language. During the early days this language had a
              round script. Later it adopted an elongated script.
              The Malayalam of today has a mixture of both.
            </p>
            <h2>
              Birth and spread of Christianity:
            </h2>
            <p>
Christianity began as a Jewish sect in the mid-1st century. Originating in the eastern Mediterranean, it quickly grew in size and influence over a few decades, and by the 4th century had become the dominant religion within the Roman Empire. During the Middle Ages, most of the remainder of Europe was Christianized, with Christians also being a sometimes large religious minority in the Middle East, North Africa, Ethiopia and parts of India. Following the Age of Discovery, through missionary work and colonization, Christianity spread to the Americas, Australasia, and the rest of the world. Christianity, therefore, is a major influence in the shaping of Western civilization.              
            </p>
            <h2>
              St. Thomas and his ministry in India:
            </h2>
            <p>
Thomas the Apostle, also called Doubting Thomas or Didymus (meaning "Twin") was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus. He is best known for disbelieving Jesus' resurrection when first told of it, then proclaiming "My Lord and my God" on seeing Jesus in John 20:28. He was perhaps the only Apostle who went outside the Roman Empire to preach the Gospel. He is also believed to have crossed the largest area, which includes the Parthian Empire and India.
</p><p>
St. Thomas is believed to have sailed to India in 52AD to spread the Christian faith among the Cochin Jews, the Jewish diaspora present in Kerala at the time. He landed at the ancient port of Muziris (which became extinct in 1341 AD due to a massive flood which realigned the coasts) near Kodungalloor. He then went to Palayoor (near present-day Guruvayoor), which was a Hindu priestly community at that time. He left Palayoor in AD 52 for the southern part of what is now Kerala State, where he established the Ezharappallikal, or "Seven and Half Churches". These churches are at Kodungallur, Kollam, Niranam (Niranam St.Marys Orthodox Church , Nilackal (Chayal), Kokkamangalam, Kottakkayal (Paravoor), Palayoor (Chattukulangara) and Thiruvithancode Arappally - the half church.
</p><p>
"It was to a land of dark people he was sent, to clothe them by Baptism in white robes. His grateful dawn dispelled India's painful darkness. It was his mission to espouse India to the One-Begotten. The merchant is blessed for having so great a treasure. Edessa thus became the blessed city by possessing the greatest pearl India could yield. Thomas works miracles in India, and at Edessa Thomas is destined to baptize peoples perverse and steeped in darkness, and that in the land of India." - Hymns of St. Ephraem, edited by Lamy (Ephr. Hymni et Sermones, IV).            
            </p>
            <h2>
              Conversion of our Forefathers:
            </h2>
            <p>
              During AD 59 in Palayoor, which was a Sea Port, there
              were lots of Jews who were traders. St. Thomas stayed
              with these traders and Evanglised people to the Christian
              faith.  The notable Brahmin families that converted to 
              the christian faith were Kalli, Kalikavu,
              Pagalomattom, and Shankarapuri.  The families of 
              Shankarapuri and Pagalomattom were given
              Priestly Status by St. Thomas.
            </p>
            <h2>
              Migrations of our forefathers from Palayoor to
              Etamanoor:
            </h2>
            <p>
              In the 2nd Century AD all the four Family migrated
              from Palayoor via Angamali, Kadathuruthi to
              Ettmanoor. The Devasom of Ettmanoor did not allow
              them to stay there and sent them to a place 5 Km.
              away which was the Forest of the Goddess Kali. In
              those days the Forest of goddess Kali was believed to
              be full of Witches and Devils and people, were scared
              to stay in such places. The people who came from
              Palayoor stayed there without any fear not knowing
              about these facts. To prove this there are documents.
              The entire house names, house numbers, survey numbers
              are there in the Government Records. Survey 460/5,
              460/6, 519/8 belonged to these Families. During those
              days there was no place for worship or Burial and the
              families worshipped at home and used their own
              property to bury the dead. Where these 4 families
              stayed they established a Chapel. There still exists
              5 Graves near the famous Forest of Kali (Kalikavu)
              Grotto. It is believed that these are the graves of 5
              important members of these families. This cemetery
              was just next to the Shakutirikal Family. Right now
              it is in the procession of Claratu Bhavan Seminary.
            </p>
            <h2>
              The Koravelangattu Church:
            </h2>
            <p>
              It is believed that the above said 4 families and the
              Kadapoor family, which came from Palayoor, joined
              together and established the Koravelangattu Church.
              The Kalli and the Pagalomattom Families stayed on the
              Northern side of the church and the Shankarapuri,
              Kalikavu and the Kadapoor families stayed on the
              Southern side of the Church. So it came to be that
              Shankarapuri Family got the house name Thekkedethu
              meaning Southern Side, and Pagalomattom Family got
              the house name Vadakaedethu meaning Northern Side.
              There were a lot of priests in these families for
              many generations.
            </p>
            <h2>
              Shankarapuri Family in different places:
            </h2>
            <p>
              From Shankarapuri family at different times many
              descendant migrated to different places. The
              descendant to Shankarapuri Family are in places like
              Kudamaloor, Eduthwa, Changanoor, Puthankavu,
              Athirampuzha, Thiruvalla, and Omallor. The
              descendants of this family are numerous and live in
              and outside Kerala.
            </p>
            <h2>
              To Arivuthura:
            </h2>
            <p>
              In AD 900 a few of the members of Shankarapuri
              settled down in Arivuthura. During that time
              Arivuthura was a trading town trading with many
              places in the Tamil Kingdom. Through Vembanattu
              backwaters and the Meenachil River, Kettuvallam (a
              kind of boat) could reach Arivuthura. So there was
              the facility to take goods to these places too. In
              Arivuthura the descendants of Shankarapuri Family
              were known as Alakkal Family. By AD 1100 a branch of
              the Alakkal Family acquired lands in Nillakal and
              traded with People from Tamil Kingdoms. One of them
              was very famous and received the title Captain
              (Caputiniar). Because of trouble with Tamil
              Militants, Wild Animals and Fatal Diseases they
              shifted their domain back to Arivuthura and also to
              Palai and Kanjirapally. It is believed that the
              Statue of Mother Mary was taken to Kanjirapally and
              the Statue of St. George was brought to Arivuthura
              from Nillakal around AD 1450.

            <h2>
              Vellichira:
            </h2>
            <p>
              From Arivuthura a branch of the Alakkal Family
              settled in Vellichira near Palai. Edattu
              Vattaparambil was this branch&rsquo;s Family Name. At
              that time one of the Vadakunkoor royal family members
              settled in Ramapuram (The place) keeping Vellilapilly
              the center of his government. They were known as
              Edathi Thamburakanmar's (Royal Family Members of
              Edathi). The members of the royal family used to go
              to Etamanoor Temple through Vellichira and they used
              to rest in Edattu Vattaparambil House.
            </p>

              Vellialpillyil:
            </h2>
            <p>
              Understanding their dedication, trustworthiness and
              ability the king invited one member of the family to
              Vellilapilly. This family was given a plot of land
              near the palace in a place called Thyiil Thoondathil
              with the privilege of not paying land revenue. Though
              there prevailed the custom of untouchability, it was
              believed that when a Christian touches one becomes
              pure. This happened around AD 1300. This family was
              the Edathi Thamburakanmar's (Royal Family Members of
              Edathi) favorite and had influence among them.

              Cholapilly:

            <p>
              As a emissary one of the a person with his family
              from Thyiil Thoondathil was made to stay near the
              Palace in a place called Cholapilly this branch came
              to be known as the Cholapilly Family. This was in AD
              1340. As long as the Vadakunkoor Dynasty stayed in
              power Cholapilly family elder had the power and title
              of a Minister. The local rulers in places like
              Manjoor, Pallam, Vikyom took people from Cholapilly
              family to look after their affairs giving them lands
              with the privilege of not paying land revenue. The
              branch at Pallam was called Poovathumootil and the
              branch at Manjoor was called Thevarparambil. There
              were also other branches around Ramapuram (The place)
              namely Vichattu, Anapara, Eerimattom etc.

            <h2>
              The Establishing the Church at Ramapuram:
            </h2>
            <p>
              During those days for the Christians who stayed in
              Ramapuram, their parish was at Koravalangad. One
              Easter day one of the elderly lady got ready to
              attend mass and reached Koozhamala Ettukallil plains.
              She heard the bell of resurrection at Koravalangad
              Church. She knelt down there and started praying and
              returned taking a vow that she would attend mass only
              after establishing a church at Ramapuram (The Place).
              She then went to meet Fr. Joseph (Ausepachhen) in
              Palai Church and informed him about the needs. Due to
              the influence of the Ministerial Post permission was
              taken and a Church dedicated to Mother Mary was
              completed at Ramapuram. Vellichira Kimal gave the
              land for the Church free. This was at around AD 1450.
              The Church at Ramapuram has been renovated several
              times since then. In AD 1559 St. Augustine&rsquo;s
              Statue was brought and the renovated Church was
              dedicated to him. In AD 1864 when the new church was
              built in memory of the old Church it was dedicated to
              Mother Mary.

            <h2>
              Famous Minister of Cholapilly:
            </h2>
            <p>
              As mentioned earlier Cholapilly family members were
              Ministers of the Edathi Thamburan's (Royal Family) by
              around 1650 the person who was in power was called
              Ausep or Joseph. There is evidence to show that he
              had influence in the decision of the Government. Once
              one of the blacksmith's of the kingdom was sentenced
              to death and the wife of the Blacksmith approached
              Ausep or Joseph Minister. The Minister coming to know
              of the truth immediately made the royal court comes
              to know of the real facts. By that time the
              Blacksmith had already been taken to the Gallows. The
              king asked Ausep or Joseph,if he could,try and stop
              the execution in time. The execution was averted just
              in the nick of time. And not to be troubled by his
              enemies the Blacksmith was relocated to a place
              called Ambara, which was beyond the boundaries of the
              Kingdom.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another Minister of Edathi Thamburan's (Royal Family)
              was a Namboodiri (Brahmin). Seeing the influence
              Ausep or Joseph Minister had with the Royal Family he
              was waiting for an opportunity to destroy the good
              rapport Joseph Minister had with the Royal Family.
              One day both of them went hunting. The Brahmin had
              hidden a Cow in the forest and when they reached
              where he had hidden the Cow he told him that there
              was a buck standing there. Without knowing that it
              was a cow Joseph shot. This was a period when cow
              slaughter was banned and Joseph was worried. The
              Brahmin then told Joseph not to be worried because
              only both of them were there. But the Brahmin himself
              in a hurry made this fact known to the Royal Family.
              Joseph was put in prison for eight days and sentenced
              to death. Joseph's wife used to bring food parcel
              during these eight days. The guards thought that if
              poison is given in the food Joseph would die and
              therefore they would not be able to carry out the
              sentence. Therefore the wife had to eat a portion of
              the food parcel before it was given to Joseph.
              Through his wife Joseph informed the Blacksmith in
              Ambara whom he had saved earlier. The Blacksmith made
              a special knife and sent it to Joseph in his food
              parcel. Joseph took it and kept it safe. When
              everyone was sleeping in the night using this knife
              he escaped to Cholapilly took his sword and shield
              and along with a son of his escaped to Ponjaar. There
              in the protection of the Local Ruler he lived in a
              place called Nadakkal. Later when he died he was
              buried in the Church at Privuthannam. Then the Church
              at Privuthannam was a Satellite Church of the Church
              at Ramapuram.

              The Son of Joseph Minister called Kurian, also became
              a minister to the Edathi Thamburan's (Royal Family).
              The Thekankoor Kings army came to Vellialpilly and
              attacked the Palace of Edathi. After setting fire to
              the palace they went to Cholapilly. Kurians diplomacy
              saved them from the catastrophe. Hospitality was
              extended to the army by giving fruits and tender
              coconuts. And from here the army went to Ramapuram
              where one of the Cholapilly family member was the
              Parish Priest. By the grace of St. Augustine and
              because of the hospitality given to the army the
              Church was spared from destruction.

            <p>
              By AD 1751 Marthanda Varma with other vassal states
              attacked and annexed Vadakunkoor. And by this the
              Region of Vellialpilly that was under the Edathi
              Thamburan's (Royal Family), also came under
              Travancore. The Ministerial status of Cholapilly
              family ended thus. However the Cholapilly Family had
              a special place among the common people and they
              retained the power to lead, control, decide and even
              punish. And this gave rise to the name CHOLLUM
              CHILUMBUM ULLA CHOLAPILLY (Cholapilly of fame and
              Glamour). When the rule of the Vadakunkoor kingdom
              came to an end, the head of the Cholapilly Family had
              5 male Children among them,
